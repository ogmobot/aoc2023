Day 6 in Kona
-------------
Gave up when I found Kona's syntax too different from the J-like syntax I was expecting. Solved Day 6 by hand and used Kona for Day 7 instead.

Day 8 in Mercury
----------------
Gave up when I couldn't figure out how to neatly set up a hash table. Solved Day 8 with CoffeeScript and used Mercury for Day 9 instead.

Day 11 in Funktal
-----------------
Gave up when I couldn't figure out how to create a linked list. Solved Day 11 with Kitten.

Day 17 in Elm
-------------
Gave up when I discovered there is no way to open a file in Elm. (Conceivably I could create a JavaScript program to load the input file, and pass it to Elm from there; or use Elm to create a web interface with a file input.) Solved Day 17 with Standard ML.

Day 18 in Nibble
----------------
Gave up when I couldn't wrap my head around how long strings of operators interacted with each other. Solved Day 18 with Sacalon.
